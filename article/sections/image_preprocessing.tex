\section{Image preprocessing}
    Motivation and approach pith.
    
    \subsection{Compression, equalization and noise reduction}
        Explain need and method... cite articles that do the same, cite articles that introduce the methods \cite{Klette:2014:CCV:2584519}.

    \subsection{Edge detection filter}
        Cite main edge detection filters, explain approach (phase congruency) and previous use of wavelet in this field.. our approach and our evaluation of different wavelet families.

        \subsubsection{Evaluation schema}
            Describe how we evaluated any choice.. optimization for example on confronting how much the defects area are highlighted.
            An effective approach to this black-box derivative-free global-optimization method is Bayesian Optimization \cite{rasmussen:williams:2006, arXiv:2018arXiv180702811F, arXiv:2012arXiv1206.2944S}
            Loss when we loose defects...
            Loss when we keep too much non defects area...
