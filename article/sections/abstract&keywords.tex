    Quality control is a main issue in any industry. The need of assuring a human-like evaluation during products quality control has resulted in an active research aiming to develop an automatic defect detection scheme.
    In this paper an effective solution to defect detection on steel surfaces from images is presented. Firstly, a preprocessing step aiming to spot plausible defective areas is discussed. Lastly, the classification of these proposed regions is made. Hence, a proper segmentation scheme is described. Incidentally, a novel usage of the dilation factor in convolutional layers is introduced, providing an effective approach to classifying images of different sizes.
