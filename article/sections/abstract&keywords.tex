    Quality control is a main issue in any industry. The need of assuring a human-comparable evaluation during products quality control has reflected on an intense research aiming to develop an automatic defect detection scheme.
    In this paper an effective solution to defect detection on steel surfaces from images is presented. Firstly, a preprocessing step aiming to spot plausible imperfections areas is discussed. Secondly, a localization and classification of defects is made. Lastly, a proper pixel-wide segmentation scheme is proposed.
